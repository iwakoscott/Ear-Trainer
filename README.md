# Ear Trainer

## Project Description

I grew up as a classical pianist, finding patterns in music. Now as I am transitioning careers into web development, I look for patterns in code. I thought it would be fun to build something that relates to my 'previous life' so I decided to build a simple ear training app. Ear training is being able to detect pitch by ear, pretty self-explanatory. While there are different areas of ear training, this app focuses on interval training (the difference in pitch between two notes).

Ear training is important, fundamental really, and will benefit you no matter your skill level as a musician. For the enthusiasts it will bring a new level of appreciation and understanding to what you hear. For the beginners, it will connect the dots between what you hear and the music theory that you are (or should be) studying. For more advanced students thinking of majoring in music, ear training will be a part of your entrance exams, so the earlier you begin learning, the better.
